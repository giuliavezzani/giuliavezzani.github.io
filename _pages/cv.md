I am a **Postdoctoral Research in Robotics and AI**.
My research goal is to investigate and improve robots' **perception** capabilities for **autonomous manipulation**.


# 6 facts about me
- _**Researcher in robotics and AI**_ with four year experience.
- Proven _**C++** skills_, with a good knowledge of YARP and iCub libraries.
- _Tensorflow_ and _Python_ knowledge for Deep Reinforcement Learning.
- Background: _Robotics_, _Bayesian filtering_, _Optimization_ and _**Deep Reinforcement Learning**_.
- Daily research and work activities on Unix-based systems.
- _Hardware experience_ with the humanoid robotic platform **iCub**.
- Main interests: **Grasping**, Localization,  **Perception**,  3D
object modeling and **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.



# Current research activity

The goal of my research is to improve robots' _perception_ and _manipulation skills_ by
exploiting both _visual_ and _tactile information_. The testing platforms for my research are both humanoid robots, such as the [iCub](http://www.icub.org/) and [R1](https://www.robotiko.it/r1-robot/) robots, and industrial manipulators, like the [Franka Emika Panda](https://www.franka.de/panda/).

Recently, I got interested in _Deep Reinforcement Learning_ and I'm currently leading a new team focused on Deep Reinforcement Learning for manipulation at the Humanoid Sensing and Perception team @ iCub Facility.

# Research Experience
Here is a summary of my experiences in research field (`click to expand`):
<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
 <summary>  <b>Visiting Scholar @ BAIR, UC Berkeley (January - July 2018)</b> </summary>
       <p style="margin-left: 25px;">     
       My research activity at Bair focuses on the design of new deep reinforcement learning techniques
        aimed at improving robot manipulation and grasping capabilities.

 <summary>  <b>Easy Peasy Robotics Mentor @ Campus Party Italia (2017)</b>  </summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">I was one of the mentors and organizers of Easy Peasy Robotics, a 2-days crash course whose aim
was to provide participants with a brief overview of the research problems and applications related to
humanoid robot programming, from perception to control. An  <b>interview</b> (in Italian)  about Campus Party experience is available <a  href="http://bancadati.datavideo.it/PortaleDV/media/20170722/20170722-rai_news_24-rai_news_24_1311-154526847m.mp4">here.</a></p></details>
<details style="margin-left: 20px;">
 <summary>  <b>Europen Project TacMan: Tactile Manipulation (2017)</b>  </summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">TacMan is a project founded by the European Union, FP7 ICT Cognitive System and Robotics, no. 610967.
        My work for the TacMan project contributed to improving <b>recognition and manipulation skills</b> for the
humanoid robot iCub. I developed a model-based tactile object localization and recognition algorithm
and a novel pipeline in order to make the iCub robot perform the <b>handover task</b>, i.e. transfer an
object from one hand to the other. A  <b>video</b> of successful handovers is available  <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be27-FGU-Sk&feature=youtu.be">here.</a></p></details>
 <details style="margin-left: 20px;">
   <summary> <b>Brains, Minds and Machines Summer School (BMM 2016)</b>  </summary>
   <p style="margin-left: 25px;"> BMM summer school is organized by Harvard Medical School
September, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, US. An intensive three-week course gives advanced students a “deep end” introduction to the problem
of intelligence – how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how we may be able to replicate
intelligence in machines. The summer school selection process is very competitive due to the increasing number of applications and the small number of available positions. In  2016,  30 students have been selected among 300 nearly. The school requires the accomplishment of a 3 week project, for which I implemented an algorithm, capable of <b>detecting and recognize activities in real videos</b>. I achieved my goal by modeling the problem through <b>Hidden Markov Models</b> and by using <b>Bayesian Regression</b> as main approach.</p>

   <summary>  <b>International Computer Vision Summer School (ICVSS 2016)</b>  </summary>
        <p style="margin-left: 25px;">The International Computer Vision Summer School is organized by University
of Cambridge and University of Catania,  Italy.
The tenth edition of ICVSS  provided both an
objective and clear overview and an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art research in Computer
Vision. The courses were delivered by world renowned experts in the field, from both academia and
industry, and covered both theoretical and practical aspects of real Computer Vision problems as
well as examples of their successful commercialisation. (Selected students: 150/396.)

  <details style="margin-left: 20px;">
    <summary>  <b>Research Fellow @ iCub Facility (2015)</b> </summary>
         <p style="margin-left: 25px;">I have partnered with the Italian Institute of Technology during my <b>M.Sc. thesis</b>, about  6D object tactile localization, i.e. the problem to estimate the 6-DOF pose of a tridimensional
 object, whose model is known,  by using the tactile measurements collected with the robot iCub.</p>

 <details style="margin-left: 20px;">
   <summary>  <b>The iCub Summer School - Veni Vidi Vici (VVV 2015)</b> </summary>
