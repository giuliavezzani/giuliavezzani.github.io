I'm a Postdoctoral Research at the iCub Facility of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) working in the Humanoid Sensing and Perception team, leaded by Lorenzo Natale. My main interests lie in **perception for autonomous robotic manipulation**. I recently got interested
in **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, in that I believe that combining classical approaches with the data-driven approaches could lead to considerable improvements in robotic manipulation.

I received my Ph. D. in _Advanced and Humanoid Robotics_ from IIT and University of Genoa, supervised by Lorenzo Natale and Ugo Pattacini. In the Spring semester 2018, I was a visiting scholar at _Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research_ (BAIR) of UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Pieter Abbeel.
